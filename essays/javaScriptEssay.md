So far JavaScript seems like a powerful tool. I've only worked with JavaScript one time while trying to make a website several years ago so its still fresh for me. I like that it is object based like java, but is a scripting language so you don’t need a compiler. ES6 adds a lot more features to JavaScript and also cleans the code up a bit. One example would be by using arrow functions which reduces the amount of code written for some functions.

Example of regular function declaration:
---
```js
//takes in 2 vars.
var sum = function (num1, num2) {
//returns sum of the 2.
    return num1 + num2;
};
```

Example of function declaration with arrow:
---
```js
//takes in 2 vars, and returns sum of the 2.
var sum = (num1, num2) => num1 + num2;
```
As you can see it reduced the code to a smaller amount to be used and understood better. It may not look like much at the moment, but after a few thousand lines of code I’m sure it reduces the code base substantially.

Practicality of JS:
---
JavaScript is a lot like other languages, which makes it easy to start learning. I believe any tool that can be used to complete a task is useful, with that being said JavaScript is has been used for a variety of applications and shows no signs of going away any time soon. Over-all I do believe JavaScript is good for software engineering because it helps people create the projects or tools they need without the extra step of using a compiler. There are plenty of framworks and documentation out on the internet to make JavaScript a easy language to pick up.


Athletic Software Engineering:
---
When it comes to athletic software engineering, not only do I believe this is one of the best ways to learn coding a new language, but also algorithms, and also typing speed. All three of these are very important in Computer Science ecspecielly when it comes to tight deadlines. I believe the preasure of having a time limit to complete a coding challange makes me want to study and practice more because i enjoy coding and i like to push the limits of my abilities. This is an area I want to focus on doing well in to help me in the coding interview phase of looking for a job. 

Conclusion:
---
In conclusion, I would have to say i love JavaScript because its a new skill to add to my portfolio and its not a huge learning curve over some of the lower level languages. I have plans to make many different apps and software over the course of my carrer and knowing JavaScript will only make me a better software developer in the long run.
