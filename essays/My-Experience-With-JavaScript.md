So far Javascript seems like a powerful tool. I like that it is object based like java and the syntax reminds me of C. ES6 adds a lot more features to Javascript and also cleans the code up a lot. One example would be by using arrow functions which reduces the amount of code written for some functions.

javascript is a lot like other languages, which makes it easy to start learning along with ES6. I believe any tool that can be used to complete a task is useful, with that being said javascript is has been used for a variety of applications and shows no signs of going away any time soon. Overall I do believe javascript is good for software engineering because it helps people create the projects or tools they need.

Not only do I believe this is one of the best ways to learn coding a new language, but also algorithms, which is a very important topic in Computer Science. This is an area I want to focus heavy on doing well in to help me in the coding interview phase of looking for a job.
