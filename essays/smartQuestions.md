Computer science can get confusing very quickly, so asking the right questions is very important as your trying to learn. What makes a question "smart"? there are many factor to smart questions, and one of the first ones starts with the person asking the question.

1: Did you check Stack Overflow?
---
A lot of people will simply post a question about somthing so common, that they could of found a million other people that have already asked that same question. Its important to ask yourself "Am i doing somthing someone else has done before?". If what your doing is very basic, then yes, most likly someone has already asked that queston and you can proboly just look it up in less time then it would to get a responce back.

2: Did you Google it?
---
If Stack Overflow fails you, try Google. Google not only can find questions from other forums then Stack Overflow, it can find web-pages made by other computer science enthusests. A majority of the time, i get my question solved by these first 2 strategies.

3: Did you check source code/documentation?
---
It should go without saying, that if you are using somone elses code, they should have some sort of documentation on that code explaining what it is and how it works. It is a Good coding practice to comment your code well to give the next person (including yourself) a better under standing of what the code is all about.

4: Did you ask a class-mate/friend?
---
If you are a Computer Science student or thinking about taking the plung, make friends with the people that have the same interests as you. You should be opening up in class to get to know the people around you so you guys can help each other when the time comes. Sometimes the people you make friends with have already learned what you are having trouble with.

Ok, so you still can't find an answer...

Nows the time you want to start getting the details ready for the question. The header should be helpful to the reader, it should give everything the reader needs to know about what you are trying to do and with what language and frameworks. The body of the question should contain your full question with source code with the trouble area clearly visable to the readers. A good tip is to Auto-Formate your code with the code editor to make it look nice and clean in stead of sloppy looking code. Like i stated in #3 above, comment your code so you know where everything is and the reader can easily see your design patern and help you solve your particular problem.

Bad Question:
---
This [LINK](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59997089/how-to-have-only-one-person-on-a-webpage-the-others-go-on-a-waiting-screen) brings you to a great example of someone who dosnt want to post the code he has writen so far.

  Body:
  ---
  If that person has even writen anything, they expect the readers to solve his problem for him without knowing what he has even tried. he even goes on in the comments to say 
   
  "I decided not to post my code because i'm almost sure I am not getting anywhere with it. I just ask for new solutions i don't know, or examples ppl have in mind ;)" 
   
   
  The post contains vauge descriptions of what the person wants and dosnt help anyone learn anything.
 
Good Question:
---
This [LINK](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5767325/how-do-i-remove-a-particular-element-from-an-array-in-javascript) is an example of a good question.

   Header: "How do I remove a particular element from an array in JavaScript?"
   ---
   This persons header is direct and gives the reader a good idea what the rest of the question is going to be about.
   
   Body:
   ---
   The body of this persons question cotains further details of the issue and some examples of what method they are using and what they  want to have done. 
   
   "I have an array of numbers, and I'm using the .push() method to add elements to it.

Is there a simple way to remove a specific element from an array? The equivalent of something like array.remove(number);.

I have to use core JavaScript - frameworks are not allowed."
