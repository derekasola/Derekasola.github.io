Computer science can get confusing very quickly, so asking the right questions is very important as your trying to learn. What makes a question "smart"? there are many factor to smart questions, and one of the first ones starts with the person asking the question.

1: Did you check Stack Overflow?
---
A lot of people will simply post a question about somthing so common, that they could of found a million other people that have already asked that same question. Its important to ask yourself "Am i doing somthing someone else has done before?". If what your doing is very basic, then yes, most likly someone has already asked that queston and you can proboly just look it up in less time then it would to get a responce back.

2: Did you Google it?
---
If Stack Overflow fails you, try Google. Google not only can find questions from other forums then Stack Overflow, it can find web-pages made by other computer science enthusests. A majority of the time, i get my question solved by these first 2 strategies.

3: Did you check source code/documentation?
---
It should go without saying, that if you are using somone elses code, they should have some sort of documentation on that code explaining what it is and how it works. It is a Good coding practice to comment your code well to give the next person (including yourself) a better under standing of what the code is all about.

4: Did you ask a class-mate/friend?
---
If you are a Computer Science student or thinking about taking the plung, make friends with the people that have the same interests as you. You should be opening up in class to get to know the people around you so you guys can help each other when the time comes. Sometimes the people you make friends with have already learned what you are having trouble with.

Ok, so you still can't find an answer...
